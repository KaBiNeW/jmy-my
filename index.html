<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">How long is 2 paragraphs in words?</h1>
<p style="color:cyan;">Usually, there are 100–200 words in a paragraph, but the conventions for appropriate length
	differ from one form of writing to the next and are influenced by a variety of factors such as medium, topic,
	audience, and purpose. Simply put, a paragraph should be as long or as short as necessary to develop a main idea.</p>
<p style="color:lime;">The average sentence length is between 15–20 words. In most cases, the shorter the sentence, the better.
	This is because in today's age, many readers have shorter attention spans and want rapid information. But, there's more to
	sentence length than just keeping them short.</p>
